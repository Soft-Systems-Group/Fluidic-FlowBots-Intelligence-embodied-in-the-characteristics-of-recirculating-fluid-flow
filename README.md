# Fluidic FlowBots: Intelligence embodied in the characteristics of recirculating fluid flow
## Accepted to RoboSoft '24, preprint arXiv:2401.16827 
This is a public repository for the paper titled above. It contains the pdf files for the paper, as well as the parametric CAD files for the FlowBots, as well as the tactile soft controller, that were described in the paper, and depicted in the Supplementary Video. We hope these files will be a great starting point for others in the field to start exploring the FlowBots concept.

## Paper description
Taking inspiration from nature, FlowBots are a new generation of soft robots that exploit the characteristics of fluid flow for analogue control, sensing, as well as actuation. All 3 of the aforementioned features are fully integrated and embodied in the interaction of the fluid with the robotâ€™s internal structural geometry, as well as the properties of the material from which the robot is built. As a result of this embodiment, FlowBots are capable of complex behaviours, without the complex routing architectures and valving manifolds that are common in fluidic systems. FlowBots can be additively manufactured as monolithic, robust parts. This approach not only saves size and mass, but also enables rapid prototyping, greater sustainability, and an expansive range of potential applications in areas such as wildlife monitoring, or nuclear decommissioning. This paper lays the foundations for a new and wide design space for soft robotic systems that use recirculating flow. By outlining our design and rapid prototyping methodology, we seek to empower others in the field to explore this new, emerging domain, and design their own FlowBots.
