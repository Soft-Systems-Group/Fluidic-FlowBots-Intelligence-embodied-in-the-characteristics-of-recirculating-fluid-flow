## Paper description
Taking inspiration from nature, FlowBots are a new generation of soft robots that exploit the characteristics of fluid flow for analogue control, sensing, as well as actuation. All 3 of the aforementioned features are fully integrated and embodied in the interaction of the fluid with the robotâ€™s internal structural geometry, as well as the properties of the material from which the robot is built. As a result of this embodiment, FlowBots are capable of complex behaviours, without the complex routing architectures and valving manifolds that are common in fluidic systems. FlowBots can be additively manufactured as monolithic, robust parts. This approach not only saves size and mass, but also enables rapid prototyping, greater sustainability, and an expansive range of potential applications in areas such as wildlife monitoring, or nuclear decommissioning. This paper lays the foundations for a new and wide design space for soft robotic systems that use recirculating flow. By outlining our design and rapid prototyping methodology, we seek to empower others in the field to explore this new, emerging domain, and design their own FlowBots.
